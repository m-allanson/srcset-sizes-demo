# About

This is a demo of the the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes of the html `img` tag.

[Skip to the demo](#demo)

## What is the srcset attribute?
The srcset attribute is a method of displaying responsive images.  It provides the browser with additional information allowing it to choose the most appropriate image for the current device.

For a given `img` element, the `srcset` attribute can be used to supply a range of responsive images to the browser along with size information to help the browser choose the correct image.

> Shortly after the browser downloads the HTML, it requests CSS and JavaScript. But before the CSS and JavaScript is done loading, the browser starts downloading images.

> Because neither the CSS nor JavaScript is complete, the browser is downloading images without knowing what the layout of the page will be. And without knowing the layout, it doesnâ€™t know what size the image element will be.

The srcset attribute provides the browser with the image size information it needs:

```
<img src="image1.jpg" alt=""
    srcset="
      image1.jpg 300w,
      image1-b.jpg 600w,
      image1-c.jpg 1200w"
>
```

## What is sizes?
> Like srcset, the sizes attribute contains a comma-separated list. This comma-separated list describes the size of the image in relation to the viewport.

```
<img src="image1.jpg" alt=""
    srcset="
      image1.jpg 300w,
      image1-b.jpg 600w,
      image1-c.jpg 1200w
    "
    sizes="
      100vw
      (min-width:600px) 66vw,
      (min-width:960px) 50vw,
    "
>
```

If the sizes attribute is left out, the browser will assume that all images are displayed at 100% of the viewport width.

## What about the picture element?
The picture element can be used for art direction when handling responsive images.

## Demo
Use this demo to see how the browser decides to load different images on the page.  Start with a narrow window and increase the width.  Try with a retina device.  

Note that the browser will not display a lower-res image once it's cached a higher-res alternative, remember to clear your cache between page loads.
